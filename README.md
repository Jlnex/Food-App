# 📝 About the Project
This is a dynamic menu application designed for a restaurant or food ordering platform, built entirely with JavaScript (no large frameworks required).

The main goal of this project was to showcase effective DOM manipulation, data fetching, and simple routing logic to handle dynamic content without relying on external libraries.

The application successfully renders menu items, allows users to navigate to a dedicated detail page for each item, and filters the menu based on category.

# ✨ Key Features
Dynamic Menu Rendering: Fetches product data from a local db.json file and dynamically creates the menu list on the homepage.

Category Filtering: Allows users to filter the menu quickly by category (e.g., Appetizers, Desserts).

Dedicated Detail Page: Implements simple URL parameter routing to display detailed information for a single food item on the detail.html page.

Pure Frontend Logic: All functionality, including data parsing and content generation, is handled using JavaScript.

Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure.

CSS3: Styling and layout.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): Core logic, data fetching, DOM manipulation, and routing.

Mock Data (db.json): Used to simulate a backend API response for product information.
